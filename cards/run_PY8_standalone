2. compile Pythia8, and main42 example (this is a example for you to generate hepmc output).
3. edit main42.cmnd (command card for main42), we need to turn on the link to the SLHA file.

 And we also need to edit tau0(mm) in PY8 and also stop decay width in SLHA file.
4. run ./main42 main42cmnd output.hep > output
